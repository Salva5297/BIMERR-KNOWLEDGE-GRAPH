# BIMERR Repository

This repository contains a summary of the transformations made to files in .epw (belonging to the meteorological domain), .xml (belonging to the building domain) and .idf (belonging to the construction domain, specifically to materials). All these transformations have been carried out for use in the European project called BIMERR, part of HORIZON 2020.
