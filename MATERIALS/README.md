## BIMERR MATERIALS FILES

In [this folder](./) we can see an example of an [idf file](./ASHRAE_2005_HOF_Materials.idf), which has been transformed into a [json file](./ASHRAE_2005_HOF_Materials.json), with which the corresponding [RDF files](./ASHRAE_2005_HOF_Materials.ttl) have been obtained by means of declarative mappings. These files contain information about materials that have been used in constructions and buildings.
